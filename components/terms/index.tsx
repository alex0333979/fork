            These Terms govern your use of this Site. The Privacy Policy

            <b>1. OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU.</b> At PassportPhotos.com, we aim to
            provide superb customer service by being polite, kind and helpful,
            and meeting commitments to you (i.e., providing you with your
            passport photo and/or passport application within specified time
            periods).
            <br />
            <br />
            To insure our commitments, we have developed this Site to be
            intuitive and user-friendly.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you follow our prompts, and if you have all of your required
            information, and if you properly complete the required form fields,
            you should not experience processing delays. Yet, if you fail to
            accurately follow our prompts, the processing of your order may be
            delayed.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is extremely important for you to understand that we cannot
            control the weather or the performance of overnight courier services
            such as Federal Express, UPS, DHL, the US Postal Service and others.
            If they experience extreme weather conditions, labor strikes,
            airport closures or lose your paperwork, for example, we cannot be
            held responsible.
            <br />
            <br />
            To avoid such scenarios, we use the industry’s best and most
            reputable courier services, but even they are not perfect 100% of
            the time.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2. WHEN DOES OUR DELIVERY COMMITMENT START.</b> Our processing
            and delivery commitment to you (i.e., 1-day turnaround, 2-day
            turnaround, 3-day turnaround, etc.) commences when we have received
            payment for services and documentation rendered.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>3. DELAYS.</b> During world health crisis and pandemic events,
            significant delays can occur that may impact PassportPhotos.com’s
            ability to deliver within communicated time frames. These delays are
            out of our control and under no circumstances shall we be held
            liable.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>4. OWNERSHIP.</b> This Site is owned by PassportPhotos.com. Your

            not transfer to you or create in you an ownership right or interest
